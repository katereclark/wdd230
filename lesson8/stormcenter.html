            Ensure that the design meets standards such as eye tracking in a straight line and proper keyboard progression for accessibility. See Designing more Efficient Forms (Links to an external site.)
            Create a new page labeled "thanks.html" that expresses gratitude for filling out the form. This page should load when the user has successfully submitted the form. The design should follow your weather site pattern and does not need to have a lot of actual content.
            Hint: Review the <form> attributes (Links to an external site.). -->
